how this code works:
it first ask the user for the phone number and that phone number's owners name
Then it asks for saving it or not
if the user typed 'y'
then the programme will ask if they want to search any number that has been saved
if the user typed 'y'
the user can now search any name and get the phone number only if that was previously stored
WHAT DID I LEARN?
i learned about the open() which apparently saves a file in python progamme and which can be later called if needed
I learned about the def() which defines a block of code think of that like a house in which you place in the furnitue,applinces etc the def() can be called by first naming whats inside of the parameters (ie,brackets),
suppose def(x) to call it you will need to type x()
